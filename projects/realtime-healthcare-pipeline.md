# Real-Time Healthcare Data Pipeline

## üìÑ Project Overview

Designed and implemented a production-grade, real-time data pipeline for a major healthcare organization, processing 1.5TB of daily data from multiple sources. The solution enables near-real-time access to critical business insights and supports data-driven decision-making across pharmacy operations.

## üéØ Objectives

- Process high-volume healthcare data (1.5TB daily) with minimal latency
- Enable real-time business intelligence and analytics
- Ensure data quality, validation, and compliance (HIPAA, GDPR, SOC 2)
- Reduce data pipeline latency from hours to minutes
- Support predictive analytics and machine learning workloads

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies & Tools

### Data Streaming & Processing
- **Apache Kafka** - Distributed event streaming platform for real-time data ingestion
- **Apache Spark (PySpark)** - Distributed data processing for batch and streaming workloads
- **Spark Streaming** - Real-time data processing with micro-batch architecture

### Cloud Infrastructure
- **AWS S3** - Scalable data lake storage for raw and processed data
- **AWS Lambda** - Serverless compute for data transformation and validation
- **AWS Glue** - ETL service for data cataloging and schema management
- **Amazon Redshift** - Cloud data warehouse for analytics-ready datasets

### Orchestration & Automation
- **Apache Airflow** - Workflow orchestration and pipeline scheduling
- **Python** - Custom data processing, validation, and business logic

### Monitoring & Data Quality
- **Custom validation frameworks** - Data quality checks at every pipeline stage
- **CloudWatch** - Pipeline monitoring, alerting, and performance metrics

## üöÄ Key Features

### 1. Multi-Source Data Ingestion
- Integrated data streams from pharmacy systems, supply chain, patient databases
- Implemented schema validation and format standardization
- Built fault-tolerant ingestion with automatic retry and error handling

### 2. Real-Time Processing
- Reduced data latency from 4+ hours to under 5 minutes
- Processed streaming data with Spark Streaming using 30-second micro-batches
- Implemented exactly-once semantics for data consistency

### 3. Data Quality & Validation
- Comprehensive validation framework ensuring 99.8% data accuracy
- Multi-layer validation: schema, business rules, referential integrity
- Automated data quality reporting and alerting

### 4. Performance Optimization
- Improved pipeline performance by 40% through:
  - Optimized Spark configurations (executor memory, parallelism)
  - S3 partitioning strategies (by date, source, data type)
  - Redshift distribution and sort keys
  - Incremental processing patterns

### 5. Compliance & Security
- Implemented encryption at rest (S3, Redshift) and in transit (TLS/SSL)
- Role-based access control (RBAC) for data access
- Comprehensive audit logging for HIPAA, GDPR, and SOC 2 compliance
- Data masking for sensitive patient information

## üìã Implementation Details
