## 📝 Technical Details

### Star Schema Design Example

```sql
-- Dimension Table: dim_customer (SCD Type 2)
CREATE TABLE dim_customer (
    customer_key BIGINT PRIMARY KEY,
    customer_id VARCHAR(50),
    customer_name VARCHAR(200),
    email VARCHAR(200),
    segment VARCHAR(50),
    effective_date DATE,
    end_date DATE,
    is_current BOOLEAN
);

-- Fact Table: fact_transactions (Partitioned)
CREATE TABLE fact_transactions (
    transaction_key BIGINT PRIMARY KEY,
    transaction_date DATE,
    customer_key BIGINT,
    product_key BIGINT,
    quantity INTEGER,
    amount DECIMAL(18,2)
)
PARTITION BY RANGE (transaction_date);
```

### Snowflake Clustering Example

```sql
-- Add cluster key for better pruning
ALTER TABLE fact_transactions 
CLUSTER BY (transaction_date, customer_key);
```

### BigQuery Partitioning & Clustering Example

```sql
-- Create partitioned and clustered table
CREATE TABLE fact_transactions (
    transaction_date DATE,
    customer_id STRING,
    product_id STRING,
    amount NUMERIC
)
PARTITION BY transaction_date
CLUSTER BY customer_id, product_id;
```
