         ‚Üì
[dbt Transformations] (Modular, version-controlled)
         ‚Üì
[Star Schema] (Fact & Dimension tables)
  ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Partitioning (by date)
  ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Clustering (by key columns)
  ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Materialized Views (for common aggregations)
         ‚Üì

         ‚Üì
[Airflow Orchestration] (Automated workflows)
```

## üöÄ Key Optimization Strategies

### BigQuery Specific Optimizations

**Implemented date-based partitioning and clustering** to reduce data scanned during queries. Created partitioned tables with automatic partition expiration policies, and added clustering on frequently filtered columns (customer_id, product_id, region) to optimize query pruning.

**Developed materialized views** for commonly accessed aggregations, refreshing on a scheduled basis to ensure data freshness while improving query response times.

### Snowflake Specific Optimizations

**Configured automatic clustering** on high-cardinality columns to maintain optimal data organization. Implemented resource monitors to control compute costs and prevent runaway queries.

**Leveraged zero-copy cloning** for development and testing environments, enabling rapid environment provisioning without duplicating storage costs.

### dbt Transformation Workflow

**Built modular, version-controlled dbt models** using incremental materialization strategies. Implemented star schema transformations joining fact tables with dimension tables, with incremental processing based on transaction dates to optimize pipeline execution time.

## üéØ Results & Business Impact

- **67% improvement** in average query performance (from 4-6 minutes to 15-30 seconds)
- **$180,000 annual cost savings** through optimized compute and storage utilization
- **500+ tables and views** optimized with proper indexing and partitioning
- **95% reduction** in query timeout errors
- **10x faster** dashboard load times for business intelligence tools
- **Enabled real-time analytics** capabilities that were previously impossible
- **Reduced data pipeline execution time** by 45% through incremental processing

## üìö Key Learnings

1. **Platform Selection Matters:** BigQuery excels at ad-hoc analytics with automatic scaling, while Snowflake provides better control over compute resources and cost predictability
2. **Dimensional Modeling is Crucial:** Proper star schema design reduced query complexity and improved performance more than any indexing strategy
3. **Partitioning Strategy:** Date-based partitioning provided the highest ROI for time-series data
4. **Monitoring is Essential:** Proactive monitoring prevented query performance regressions and caught issues early
5. **Incremental Migration:** Parallel systems during migration ensured data accuracy and reduced risk

## üîÑ Ongoing Optimization

- Weekly review of query performance using Stackdriver and Snowflake dashboards
- Monthly cost analysis and resource optimization reviews
- Quarterly schema refinement based on new business requirements
- Continuous dbt model development for emerging analytical needs
